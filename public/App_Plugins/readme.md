# The App_Plugins Mock Directory

This App_Plugins directory is a mock for any external extensions/packages files added to the CMS. These files are referenced through manifests.

A [mocked server request](../../src/mocks/domains/manifests.handlers.ts) is made when the app starts to fetch manifest files.
