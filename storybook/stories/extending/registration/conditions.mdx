## UI Extension Conditions

Many of the Extension Types can be configured with conditions. These conditions are used to determine if the extension should be used or not.

The conditions are defined as an array of conditions. When all of the conditions are good an extension can be used.

### Using conditions

Describe the following example:

```typescript
... insert example here.
```

- `alias`- The alias of the condition to utilize.
  The rest of the properties of the object are specific to the condition.

### Core conditions types

List the build in ones, and link to the docs for them.

### Make your own conditions

You can make your own conditions by creating a class that implements the `UmbExtensionCondition` interface.

```typescript
...
```

This has to be registered in the extension registry, like this:

```typescript
...
```
