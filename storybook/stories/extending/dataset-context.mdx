# Dataset Context

The dataset context is a context which holds the data for a set of properties.
Property Editors UIs requires the dataset context to be present to work. This enables Property Editor UIs to have a generic relation with its ownership.

The Dataset context holds a name and a set of properties. What makes a property can vary but we require a alias and a value.

## Dataset in relation to Property Editors and Workspaces.

A dataset context is the connection point between a Property Editor and a Workspace.

The hirachy is as follows:
- Workspace Context
	- Dataset Context
		- Property Editor UIs

A dataset covers a set of properties, in some cases a workspace then needs to have multiple datasets. An example of such is variants of the Document Workspace. Each variant have their own dataset.

## Setup a Dataset context

It would be good to have examples for developers to see how to setup a dataset context, in code. (This might need to be a tutorial demonstrating implementing a simple workspace with a dataset with Property Editor UIs)
