# Workspace Context

A Workspace context is a container for the data of a workspace. It is a wrapper around the data of the entity that the workspace is working on. It is also responsible for loading and saving the data to the server.

(rough notes)

- A workspace context knows about its entity type (e.g. content, media, member, etc.) and holds its unique string (ex: key).
- Most workspaces contexts holds a draft state of its entities data. It is a copy of the entity data that can be modified at runtime and send to the server to be saved.

If a workspace wants to utilize Property Editor UIs, then it must provide a dataset context for the property editors. The dataset is the generic interface between workspace and property editors. See dataset contexts for more info.

TODO: More points and examples:

```ts
// TODO: get typescript interface
interface UmbWorkspaceContext {}
```

## Examples of workspaces:

TODO: link to all workspaces in storybook. Can we somehow auto-generate this list?
