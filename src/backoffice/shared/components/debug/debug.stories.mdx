# Debugging

## Debugging Contexts

The component `<umb-debug>` allows you to discover the available contexts from the current DOM element, that you are able to consume and use.

For example it will help you as a package developer or implementor to know you are able to consume the `DigalogService` and quickly see what properties and methods are available to use.

This can help with the developer experience to quickly see what is available to use and how to use it.

### Usage
The `<umb-debug>` component can be used in two different ways


```typescript
// This will add 
<umb-debug enabled></umb-debug>
```

This example uses an additional property/attribute `dialog` which adds a smaller badge to the UI as opposed to a button and will open the information in a small dialog/modal from the right hand side.

```typescript
// This will open the debug information in a small dialog/modal from the right hand side
<umb-debug enabled dialog></umb-debug>
```

You may wish to temporarily hide or disable the debug information but return to it later on in the development process.

```typescript
// To hide or remove the button ensure you remove the enabled attribute or set the enabled property to false
<umb-debug></umb-debug>
```
